### SectionHighlight

Having the smallest file size possible is recommended. Experiment with different bitrate values and consider shortening the video if a desirable image quality cannot be attained within the file size threshold.

Strive to create a video with about 4 or 5 clips max (preferably less), keeping the edit not too fast-paced.

Depending on the negative space of the asset, the title can be displayed in one of the following three positions: top, center or bottom. The text is interchangeable based on timestamps and can be changed to all three positions. Please be aware that it is currently not possible to choose a different position for each breakpoint.

Ensure that the copy passes the accessibility tests by adjusting the video to be either dark or light enough in the specific areas.
